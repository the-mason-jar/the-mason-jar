===========

A hot & spicy pepper vodka infusion for those who enjoy a hot and firy bloody.


Ingredients
-----------

* 1 serrano pepper, stemmed, seeded, and quartered lengthwise
* 1 jaiapeño pepper, stemmed, seeded, and quartered lengthwise
* 1 red habanero pepper, stemmed, seeded, and quartered lengthwise
* One 750 ml bottle of Tito's vodka.


Preparation
-----------

* Place chilies into an infuser or large glass jar, pour in vodka.
* Let steep for overnight.
* Strain the infused vodka into a new, clean bottle.
* Cap tightly, and refrigerate (or put in the freezer) until ready to serve.


Notes
-----------

* Be careful with the peppers. Wash your hands right after handling them, or use gloves. Whatever you do, don't touch your face with pepper still on you!
* Taste often.
* You can add one hole pepper as well. Make the infusion look a bit more bad-ass.
* The longer you leave it, the hotter it'll get. If you want something a bit milder, pull out the chilis.
* Higher proof vodka will infuse faster. Keep that in mind.
* Don't infuse for too long, it'll get a little funky or bitter.
* Be sure and strain the vodka well. A coffee fitler works well for this. You don't want any particles breaking down over time in your infusion.
