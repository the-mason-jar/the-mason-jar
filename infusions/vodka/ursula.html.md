This cucumber vodka infusion is for those wanting a nice, crisp base for their drinks. Can also be served right out of the freezer as a nice refreshing shot.


Ingredients
-----------
* 1 large English cucumber, cored and chopped
* One 750 ml bottle of Tito's vodka

Preparation
-----------

* Put the cucumber into an infuser or large glass jar, pour in vodka.
* Seal and store in a cool, dark place for 3-4 days.
* Strain the infused vodka into a new, clean bottle.
* Cap tightly, and refrigerate (or put in the freezer) until ready to serve.


Notes
-----------

* Add 1 Argentinian cucumber, sliced lenth-wise into strips, for aesthetics.
* Try and make sure all the cucumber is covered. If it isn't it'll dry out and/or wilt.
* Turn and/or shake once daily, to make sure all the vodka is infused evenly.
* Make sure to taste often.
* Be sure and strain the vodka well. A coffee filter works well for this. You don't want any particles breaking down over time in your infusion.
