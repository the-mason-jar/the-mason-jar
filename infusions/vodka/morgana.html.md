A spicy vodka infusion created to cater to those who enjoy the best kind of bloody mary, one with bold flavor and a good dose of heat.

Ingredients
-----------

* 2 whole ancho chilis (aka poblano peppers)
* A bit fresh cilantro
* 2 stalks lemon grass
* 1-2 tsp dried orange peel
* Fresh lemon peel
* 4 fresh bay leaves
* 1 tsp juniper berries
* 1 tsp allspice seeds
* 4 black cardamom pods
* 2 Peeled garlic cloves
* Pinch each of celery salt, cumin seeds, garlic/onion poweder and coriander
* One 750 ml bottle of Tito's vodka

Preparation
-----------

* Carefully place items into an infuser or large glass jar, pour in vodka.
* Let steep overnight.
* Strain the infused vodka into a new, clean bottle.
* Cap tightly, and refrigerate (or put in the freezer) until ready to serve.

Notes
-----------

* This one has a lot going on. When fitering you might need to do several passes. The idea is to not let anything through, unless you plan of drinking right away. It'll usually show up a bit golden, and that's ok, but if there are left over spices floating in there and you plan on storing it, give it another pass.
* Bay leaves don't keep well. Go fresh!
* Taste often.
* The longer you leave it, the hotter it'll get. If you want something a bit milder, pull out the chilis.
* Higher proof vodka will infuse faster. Keep that in mind.
* Keep an eye on the cilantro, it gets wilty quickly and might need to be taken out.
* Don't infuse for too long, it'll get a little funky or bitter.
* Be sure and strain the vodka well. A coffee filter works well for this. You don't want any particles breaking down over time in your infusion.
* Adding a little fresh dill can add an interesting twist.

Experimentation notes
-----------

* Remove lemongrass? Something makes this slightly bitter. That might be it.
