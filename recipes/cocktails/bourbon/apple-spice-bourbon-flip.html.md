A great holiday/winter warmer [as featured on Apartment 34.](http://apartment34.com/2013/11/tasty-tuesday-bourbon-anyone/)

Ingredients
-----------

* 2 1/2 oz Bourbon whiskey
* 3/4 oz. [apple spice simple syrup](http://www.the-mason-jar.com/extras/garnishes/apple-spice-simple-syrup.html)
* 1 egg white
* Nutmeg or cinnamon for garnish

Technique
-----------

1. Place Bourbon, syrup and egg whites dry (no ice) into shaker and shake for 20 seconds.2. Add a cup of ice to the shaker and shake for another 20 seconds.
3. Strain into a coupe and sprinkle with cinnamon or nutmeg, or both!

Notes
-----------

* A hearty shake, both dry and with ice, is key. The egg whites are there to add some nice pleasant froth and that requires some shake n' bake!
* If you're making this for a lot of people, try pre-mixing the garnish.
* If the egg white smells funny, a careful little spash of citrus (squeeze a lemon on it) or bitters can help.
