A modern take on the Bronx Cocktail made popular in the gin crazed America of the 1930s. A wonderfully light cocktail that suits an afternoon refresher, or a brunch option as a heavier drop-in for a mimosa.

* 1 1/2 oz Plymouth gin
* 1/4 oz Italian sweet vermouth
* 1/4 oz French dry vermouth
* 1/2 oz fresh orange juice
* 1/4 oz fresh lemon juice
* 1/4 oz simple syrup
* orange twist for garnish

Technique
-----------

1. Add ingredients into an ice-filled cocktail shaker. Shake for 10 seconds.
2. Strain into cocktail glass.
3. Garnish with orange twist.
4. Enjoy.
