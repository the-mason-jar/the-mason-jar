The Michelada of Doom. Don't worry, it's not that spicy. (Still in work.)

Spice Mix Ingredients
-----------
* 1/4 cup chili powder
* 1 tbsp cayenne pepper
* 1 tsp each garlic powder, ground black pepper, salt and paprika.

Drink Ingredients
-----------
* 1 tbsp spice mix from above
* Juice from one or two medium limes
* 1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce
* 1/2 tbsp Bragg's liquid aminos
* 1 tsp peperoncini juice
* 1/2 cup tomato juice
* 10-12 oz lager beer (Tecate)
* [Volcano salt](/extras/garnishes/volcano-salt.html) for garnish.

Preparation
-----------

* Prepare the spice mix in a small bowl by simply mixing all the spices together.
* Slice the limes.
* Use one of the lime halves to coat the edge of a large glass with juice, dip in [Volcano salt](/extras/garnishes/volcano-salt.html) to rim it with salt.
* Squeeze the remaining lime juice into the glass.
* Add ice. About half full is good.
* Dump 1 tbsp of the spice mix into the glass.
* Add Worcestershire, Bragg's and peperoncini juice. Stir well.
* Add tomato juice, stir again.
* Slowly pour in the beer. Stirring as you go.

Notes
-----------

* Add a dash or two of hot sauce if it's not hot enough for you.
* Be sure and use a large glass!

Experimentation notes
-----------

* Try with a darker, bolder lager or Schwarzbier.
