A nice, sweet and citrus-based Michelada.

Ingredients
-----------
* 1-2 oz [Sangrita Tradicional](/extras/garnishes/sangrita-tradicional.html)
* 1 oz tequila
* 10-12 oz lager beer (Tecate)
* 1 halved lime
* [Volcano salt](/extras/garnishes/volcano-salt.html) for garnish.

Preparation
-----------

* Pour sangrita into a glass.
* Add tequila.
* Slice the limes. Use one of the lime halves to coat the edge of a large glass with juice, dip in [Volcano salt](/extras/garnishes/volcano-salt.html) to rim it with salt.
* Squeeze the remaining lime juice into the glass.
* Add ice. About half full is good.
* Slowly pour in the beer.

Notes
-----------

* It's better if you don't stir too much, if you want to get a nice mix, drink with a staw at the sweet spot where the beer meets the mix.
* Add a dash or two of hot sauce if it's not hot enough for you.
* Be sure and use a large glass!
