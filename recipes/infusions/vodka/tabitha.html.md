A slightly sweet watermelon & rosemary infusion.


Ingredients
-----------
* 3-6 cups cubed watermelon
* 2 springs fresh rosemary
* One 750 ml bottle of Tito's vodka.


Preparation
-----------

* Place cubed watermelon into a large, airtight jar.
* Fill the jar with vodka to cover the cubes.
* Seal jar and store in a cool, dark place for 6 days.
* Add rosemary sprigs on day 4.
* Strain the vodka into a clean jar or bottle.
* Discard watermelon and rosemary sprigs.


Notes
-----------

* Turn and/or shake the jar once a day or so, to make sure the vodka is more evenly infused.
* Make sure to taste often. If left too long the rosemary sprigs can over power the watermelon flavor.
* Be sure and strain the vodka well. A coffee fitler works well for this. You don't want any particles breaking down over time in your infusion.
* Great for use in watermelon bloody marys.
