A spicy vodka infusion created to cater to those who enjoy the best kind of bloody mary, one with bold flavor and a good dose of heat.

Ingredients
-----------

* 2 whole ancho chilis (aka poblano peppers)
* A bit fresh cilantro
* 2 stalks lemon grass
* 1-2 tsp dried orange peel
* Fresh lemon peel
* 4 fresh bay leaves
* 1 tsp juniper berries
* 1 tsp allspice seeds
* 4 black cardamom pods
* 2 Peeled garlic cloves
* Pinch each of celery salt, cumin seeds, garlic/onion poweder and coriander
* One 750 ml bottle of Tito's vodka

Preparation
-----------

* Carefully place items into an infuser or large glass jar, pour in vodka.
* Let steep overnight.
* Strain the infused vodka into a new, clean bottle.
* Cap tightly, and refrigerate (or put in the freezer) until ready to serve.

Notes
-----------

* Bay leaves don't keep well. Go fresh!
* Taste often.
* The longer you leave it, the hotter it'll get. If you want something a bit milder, pull out the chilis.
* Higher proof vodka will infuse faster. Keep that in mind.
* Keep an eye on the cilantro, it gets wilty quickly and might need to be taken out.
* Don't infuse for too long, it'll get a little funky or bitter.
* Be sure and strain the vodka well. A coffee filter works well for this. You don't want any particles breaking down over time in your infusion.
* Adding a little fresh dill can add an interesting twist.
