At the corner of Haight and Steiner you'll find Maven. While known for their great cocktails and wonderful kitchen, one pairing stand outs above the rest. That being, the 'Chamomile Mile High Club' and the Maven Burger. Now, of course, I can't deliver the burger, but I'm happy to bring the cocktail. A special thanks to Kate Bolton for graciously revealing her recipe.
