[In Progress. Needs a better name.] Vegan nog is quicker, easier and healthier to make than traditional eggnog. This here is a fun take on a holiday classic.


Ingredients
-----------

* 1 ripe avocado
* 2 cups coconut milk
* 3 cups almond milk
* 1/2 cup agave nectar
* 1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
* Pinch ground cloves
* 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
* Pinch kosher salt
* 4 cups Bourbon
* 1/2 cup dark rum
* 1 teaspoon freshly ground nutmeg
* 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground cinnamon


Technique
-----------

1. Combine coconut and almond milk in a container.
2. Chill milk mixture and avocado in the freezer for about 45 minutes. (They shouldn't be frozen but they should be cold and frosty.)
3. Slice avocado in half, remove the pit, peel it and place in a blender. Add milk mixture, agave, vanilla, cloves, lemon juice and salt. Blend nog until smooth.
4. Add bourbon, rum, cognac and stir (or pulse in blender.)
5. Pour into glasses, garnish with nutmeg and cinnamon and enjoy!


Notes

* A variation of [Matrioshka Eggnog](http://www.theppk.com/2010/12/matrioshka-eggnog/)
