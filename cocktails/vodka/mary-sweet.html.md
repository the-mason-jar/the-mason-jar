A unique take on the bloody mary, for those who like things a bit sweeter. Makes a terrific virgin mary.

Mix Ingredients
-----------

* 8 cups watermelon, chunked, remove rinds
* 1 teaspoon sugar, or to taste
* 2 cups tomato juice
* 1 1/2 tsp Worcestershire sauce
* 1 1/4 tsp kosher salt
* Few dashes of hot sauce to taste
* Pinch celery salt
* Freshly ground pepper


Mix Preparation
-----------
* Puree watermelon and sugar in blender.
* (Optional if you want a thinner consistency.) Strain into a bowl or jar through sieve, pressing with a rubber spatula; discard solids.
* Stir in tomato juice, salt, Worcestershire sauce, and hot sauce.
* Season with pepper and celery salt.
* Stir or shake well and prepare to serve.

The Mary Sweet
-----------

* Edge a large class with sugar or salt.
* Pour in a shot or two of [Tabitha watermelon & rosemary vodka](http://www.the-mason-jar.com/infusions/vodka/tabitha.html). Strain if needed.
* Pour in the mix, fill about 2/3rds of the glass.
* Add ice. Be sure and leave some room in the glass.
* Garnish with a watermellon slice and/or celery.


Notes
-----------

* You can leave the seeds in if you want, after pureed they don't alter the taste much.
* For a boozy variation, use a bit the left over watermelon from infusing [watermelon vodka](http://www.the-mason-jar.com/infusions/vodka/tabitha.html). Don't use too much though, as it greatly alters the flavor.
* Adjust the watermelon to tomato juice ratio to vary the sweetness.
* Be careful with the hot sauce. It gets spicy pretty quick, so go easy if you want sweet.
* Go easy on both celery and pepper as they can overwhelm the taste a bit.
* For a vegan version, use soy sauce or mix a bit of Bragg's Amino Acid with tamarind paste instead of Worchestershire.
