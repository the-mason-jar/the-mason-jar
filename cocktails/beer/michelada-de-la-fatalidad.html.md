The Michelada of Doom. Don't worry, it's not that spicy. (Still in work.)

Spice Mix Ingredients
-----------
* 1/4 cup chili powder
* 1 tbsp cayenne pepper
* 1 tsp each garlic powder, ground black pepper, salt and paprika.

Drink Ingredients
-----------
* 1 tbsp spice mix from above
* Juice from one or two medium limes

* 1/2 tbsp Bragg's liquid aminos
* 1 tsp peperoncini juice
* 1/2 cup tomato juice
* 10-12 oz lager beer (Tecate)
* [Volcano salt](/extras/garnishes/volcano-salt.html) for garnish.

Preparation
-----------

* Prepare the spice mix in a small bowl by simply mixing all the spices together.
* Slice the limes.
* Use one of the lime halves to coat the edge of a large glass with juice, dip in [Volcano salt](/extras/garnishes/volcano-salt.html) to rim it with salt.
* Squeeze the remaining lime juice into the glass.

* Dump 1 tbsp of the spice mix into the glass.
