The Pickled Mary
===========

[In Progress]. A spicy pickled take. Base loosely off of McClure's Spicy Bloody Mary Mix, which is awesome.

Mix Ingredients
-----------

* 1 cup Pickle Juice [You can use McClures spicy brine](http://www.mcclurespickles.com/products/brine)
* Freshly chopped peppers
* Chopped garlic
* Tomato Paste
* 1/2 cup cucumber juice
* 1 1/4 tsp kosher salt
* fresh dill
* Freshly ground black pepper


Mix Preparation
-----------
* Chop the peppers and garlic into small chunks. Place them in large Dutch oven.  Add a splash of water, cover the pot, and cook until the vegetables are mushy, 30 – 40 minutes.  Stir occasionally, breaking up the vegetables with the back of a spoon.  When everything is mushy, leave to cool for a few minutes.
* Puree the veggies with the tomato paste.
* Add everything else.
* Season with pepper and celery salt.
* Stir or shake well and prepare to serve.

The Pickled Mary
-----------

* Edge a large class with [salt]().
* Pour in a shot or two of [Ursula vodka](). Strain if needed.
* Pour in the mix, fill about 2/3rds of the glass.
* Add ice. Be sure and leave some room in the glass.
* Garnish with a variety of pickled goods.


Notes
-----------

* Go easy on both celery and pepper as they can overwhelm the taste a bit.
